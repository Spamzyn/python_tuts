## Project Overview

This project consists of two separate Python applications:
1. **Alarm Clock** - A graphical alarm clock that allows users to set an alarm at a specific time and plays an audio file when the alarm goes off.
2. **Dynamic Clock** - A digital clock that displays the current time and dynamically changes the background color based on the time of day (Morning, Afternoon, or Evening).
